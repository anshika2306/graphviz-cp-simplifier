# Graphvis-CP-Simplifier

This project aims to provide data structure animation support. Currently, we have Unweighted Graphs available to be used.
We have implemented the following animations. The project will support many other animations as well that use unweighted graph.

1. Depth First Search Animation (DFS)
2. Multisource Breadth First Search Animation (BFS)
3. Cycle Detection in a Directed Graph Animation



## How to run?

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the terminal and navigate to graphviz-cp-simplifier/dsa_animator
3. Use this command to run the server
    ```bash
    $ python3 manage.py runserver
    ```
4. Open the browser and navigate to 
   1. DFS: <localhost:8000/animate>
   2. Multisource BFS: <localhost:8000/animate/multi_source_bfs>
   3. Cycle Detection in a Directed Graph: <localhost:8000/animate/cycle_detection_direct>
